title: Jest testing react with @testing-library
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

As oposed to [[enzyme|Jest testing react with enzyme]], you can use @testing-library with jest.

# [[Jest install]], or if you want typescript [[Add typescript with jest]]
# <<copy-text "npm i -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom">> (you might need to install a lower version of @testing-library/react if it complains about 'react-dom')
# If you're using babel, <<copy-text "npm i -D @babel/preset-react">> and add it to `babel.config.js`
# Start writing tests, see their [[example|https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro]] and [[cheatsheet|https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet]]
