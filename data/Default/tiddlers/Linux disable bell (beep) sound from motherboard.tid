title: Linux disable bell (beep) sound from motherboard
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Remove `pcspkr` module from your system:

```
sudo rmmod pcspkr
```

Then, if you reboot, the sound will be back. What you need to do is blacklisting this module from loading when you're booting:

```sh
# create a file at /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf
sudo nvim /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf

# add this line to the file
blacklist pcspkr
```
