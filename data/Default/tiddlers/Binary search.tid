title: Binary search
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Binary search is performed on sorted collections and has a complexity of `O(log n)`.
It is part of `Divide and Conquer` algorithms and the key target in each step is to make the solution domain smaller, by eliminating portions that don't satisfy the requirements.
