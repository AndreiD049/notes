type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Checking for NULL in [[T-SQL]] is done like below:

```sql
-- Check if valus is null
X IS NULL

-- Check if value is not null
X IS NOT NULL

-- Example 
SELECT Customer AS Name 
    FROM Customers 
    WHERE Country IS NOT NULL; 
```

It is not a comparison predicate, it's a state predicate. It can only evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE` (see [[3VL or Ternary logic]])
