title: Snapshot testing with enzyme
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In order to test a component using snapshots, <<copy-text "npm i -D enzyme-to-json">>. It ensures that snapshot is saving only component's own markup, without unnecesary things from enzyme itself.

Example:

```js
import * as React from "react";
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import toJson from "enzyme-to-json";
import { CountDown } from "./CountDown";

test("should render correctly", () => {
  const wrapper = shallow(<CountDown startTime={30} />).toJSON();
  expect(toJson(wrapper)).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```
