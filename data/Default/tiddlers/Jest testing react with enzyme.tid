title: Jest testing react with enzyme
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

In order to test react components, install `enzyme`:

<<copy-text "npm i -D enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 @types/enzyme jest-environment-jsdom">>

Create following setup files:

```js
// ./tests/setupTest.js
const { configure } = require("enzyme");
const Adapter = require("enzyme-adapter-react-16");
configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });

```

Then add this to your `jest.config.js`

```js
// The paths to modules that run some code to configure or set up the testing environment before each test
setupFiles: ["./tests/setupTest.js"],
```
